      <h2>The Royal Game of Ur - Rules</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>
          <b>Objective:</b> Be the first player to move all 7 of your pieces off
          the board.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Players:</b> Two-players, black vs white. When playing against the
          AI, you play as black.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Dice:</b> A tetrahedral die is rolled each turn (virtually). The
          chances of getting a 2 is double that of getting 1, 3 or 4.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Movement:</b>
          <ol>
            <li>Click "Roll Dice".</li>
            <li>
              Click a highlighted piece (e.g. âš« when playing black) to move it
              the rolled number of squares along its path.
            </li>
            <li>Pieces start off-board.</li>
            <li>
              Path: As black, your pieces start going left on the outbound
              direction following the bottom row, while as white, your pieces
              follow the top row. Your pieces are completely safe at this stage.
              At the end of that 'home row' you continue the outbound direction
              going right along the middle row where you are now at risk of
              being taken by the opponent. Just before the last square of the
              middle row, white pieces will go up, while black pieces will go
              down to the two side squares. Once you leave the side square and
              go into the middle row you start the pieces return direction and
              the piece will be highlighted in purple. You start the return
              direction by going left along the other side squares before
              returning to the middle row and going left till the end of the
              middle row. The journey ends on the way back at the end of the
              middle row.
            </li>
          </ol>
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Rosettes:</b> Landing exactly on a rosette square (coloured red)
          grants an immediate extra roll.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Taking Pieces:</b> Landing exactly on a square occupied by a single
          opponent piece sends it back to the start. This cannot happen on safe
          squares or stackable squares. Pieces must be going in the same
          direction (outbound/return) to take each other.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Stackable Squares:</b> Squares with the concentric square markings
          can hold multiple pieces (up to 4) and are safe. Only the top piece
          can move from this square meaning you can trap the opponent under you!
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Private Stackable Square:</b> The square with the concentric dotted
          circles is like other stackable squares, but only the player who
          occupies it first can add more pieces to it. Once no one is on this
          square, then it is open to be occupied again by the next player that
          lands on it first.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Return Safe Square:</b> The square with the green corners is safe
          *only* for pieces on their return journey.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Exiting:</b> Pieces exit after passing the final square (the Return
          Safe Square) on the return journey. You must roll the exact number
          needed to land *exactly* off the board. E.g., from the Return Safe
          Square, you need a roll of 1 to exit.
        </li>
